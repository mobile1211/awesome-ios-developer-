## Coding convention
set of guidelines for a specific programming language that recommend programming style

### Swift Style Guide

- [Swift Style Guide](https://github.com/linkedin/swift-style-guide)

### Swift Lint
The way of force you to adapt coding convention 
>otherwise project build will **FAILED**
- [Swift Lint](https://github.com/realm/SwiftLint) apply for all project:+1:
```swift
if which swiftlint >/dev/null; then
  swiftlint
else
  echo "error: SwiftLint not installed, download from https://github.com/realm/SwiftLint"
  exit 1
  fi
```
put .yml file into root folder and apply following code in Build Phases

**You can modify(delete) SwiftLint Option with opening .yml file**

> Shift + Command + . will show the hidden file

## Design Pattern

Check [this](https://refactoring.guru/design-patterns/swift) website for design pattern in Swift

## Adaptor

## Delegation

```swift
weak var delegate: SomeProtocol?
```

## Factory

## Observer

Observer is a behavioral design pattern that allows some objects to notify other objects about changes in their state.

 - Observer - An object that wishes to be notified when the state of another object changes.
 - Subject (Observable) - An object that maintains a list of observers, and inform them of state changes usually by calling one of their methods. An observable slightly differs in this in that it is just a function that sets up an observation.
 - Subscribe - An observer lets a subject know that it wants to be informed of changes through a process called subscribing.

## Singleton

```swift
class SingletonPattern {
    static let manager = SingletonPattern()
    
    private init() {}
}
```

## Code Structuring(Architecture)

### MVC

MVC pattern stands for Model - View - Controller

<img src="https://github.com/jphong1111/Useful_Swift/blob/main/Images/MVCModel.png">

 - Model - Model take care of storing data.
 - View - View renders the data for users
 - Controller - Controller modifies the View, accepts user input and interacts directly with the Model. And take care of view logic and business logic.

### MVP


### MVVM

MVVM patterns stand for Model - View - ViewModel

##### MVC vs MVVM

<img src="https://github.com/jphong1111/Useful_Swift/blob/main/Images/MVVMvsMVC.png" width = "60%" height = "60%">

 - Model ‚Äì Which holds the application data

 - View ‚Äì It displays the data that is stored in model. These are visual elements through which a user interacts. These are subclasses of UIView

 - View Model ‚Äì Transform model information/data and it interacts with controller or view to display those informations.

 - Controller class ‚Äì It will be there but the responsibility of view business logic has been removed and give to view model

> You can check App example of using MVVM [here](https://github.com/jphong1111/Unsplash_Clone)

### VIPER

<img src="https://github.com/jphong1111/Useful_Swift/blob/main/Images/Viper.png">

 - View - Displays what it is told to by the Presenter and relays user input back to the Presenter.
 - Interactor -  Contains the business logic as specified by a use case.
 - Presenter - contains view logic for preparing content for display (as received from the Interactor) and for reacting to user inputs (by requesting new data from the Interactor).
 - Entity - contains basic model objects used by the Interactor.
 - Routing - contains navigation logic for describing which screens are shown in which order.

**These helper files are not with Error Handling! careful at use**

## Email, Message, Call

You can check the file in the follow link

- [Email, Message, Call](https://github.com/jphong1111/Useful_Swift/blob/main/Helper/ConversationHandler/ConversationManager.swift)

### Usage
import MessageUI first

```swift
import MessageUI
```

Then use it
> Don't forget to extend the mail, message delegate to your ViewController!

```swift
    lazy var conversation = ConversationManager(presentingController: self, mailDelegate: self, messageDelegate: self, viewController: self)
    
    @IBAction private func sendEmail(_ sender: UIButton) {
        conversation.sendEmail(feedback: MailFeedback(recipients: ["abcd@google.com"], subject: "FeedBack", body: "Write feedback here"))
    }
    @IBAction private func sendMessage(_ sender: UIButton) {
        conversation.sendMessage(feedback: MessageFeedBack(recipients: ["1111111111"], body: "Type here"))
    }
    @IBAction private func startCall(_ sender: UIButton) {
        conversation.makeCall(number: "1111111111")
    }
```

## Network Layer

- [Network Layer](https://github.com/jphong1111/Useful_Swift/tree/main/Helper/Network%20Layer) 

### Usage

First, set the base URL in **EndPointType file**
> Don't forget to put your API key in it!

```swift
var baseURL: URL {
        guard let url = URL(string: "https://api.openweathermap.org/data/2.5/") else {
            fatalError("baseURL could not be configured.")
        }
        return url
    }
```

then make a instance of router.swift file in your code

```swift
private let router = Router<YourAPI>()
```

for **YourAPI part**, simply create a new **enum** with cases about specific api URL
> It will make your router more dynamic!
> Don't forget extension to EndPointType!

```swift
enum YourAPI {
    case first(country: String)
    case second(time: Int)
    case third(name: String)
}

extension YourAPI: EndPointType {
    var path: String {
        switch self {
        case .first(let country):
            return "\(country).json"
        case .second(let time):
            return "\(time).json"
        case .third(let name):
            return "\(name).json"
        }
    }
}
```

then, use it like this

```swift
router.request(.first(country: London)) { [weak self] (results: Result<CountryWeather, AppError>) in
            guard let self = self else { return }
            switch results {
            case .success(let data):
                // insert your modifications!
                
            case .failure(let error):
                // insert your modifications!
                print(error)
            }
        }
```

> **CountryWeather should be a model with Decodable**

If you want to see how can I use Network Layer in Project, check [this](https://github.com/jphong1111/Unsplash_Clone/tree/main/Unsplah_Clone/ReusableComponent/NetworkLayer)

This reusable network layer files for referenced from [here](https://medium.com/flawless-app-stories/writing-network-layer-in-swift-protocol-oriented-approach-4fa40ef1f908)

> Also [Alamofire](https://github.com/Alamofire/Alamofire) will be a great option for Network Layer!

## Image Picker

- [Image Picker](https://github.com/jphong1111/Useful_Swift/blob/main/Helper/ImagePickerHandler/ImagePicker.swift) 

### Usage

Copy and Paste in your project and then declare Image Picker object inside your project 

```swift
lazy var imagePicker = ImagePicker(presentationController: self, delegate: self)
```

Then, extend ImagePickerDelegate to your viewController

```swift
extension ViewController: ImagePickerDelegate {
    func didSelect(image: UIImage?) {
        self.yourImageView.image = image
        self.dismiss(animated: true, completion: nil)
    }
}
```

## File Manager

- [File Manager](https://github.com/jphong1111/awesome-ios-developer/blob/main/Helper/FileManageHandler/FileManager.swift) 

### Usage

Copy and Paste in your project 

```swift
let readData = FileManageHelper.manager.readFile(filename: fileNameTextField.text ?? "", type: extensionTextField.text ?? "")
resultTextField.text = readData
```
> File Manager are wrote with singleton pattern, therefore no need to declare in side your code!

## Video Downloader

- [Video Downloader](https://github.com/jphong1111/awesome-ios-developer/blob/main/Helper/VideoDownloadHandler/VideoDownloadManager.swift) 

## Usage

Make an object of VideoManager inside your code

```swift
let videoManager = VideoManager()
```

use downloadVideoLinkAndCreateAsset function to start download with entering URL

```swift
self.videoManager.downloadVideoLinkAndCreateAsset(text)
```

## Image Downloader

There is no file for Image Downloader.

To download images into device, only thing is this

```swift
if let data = try? Data(contentsOf: urls),
   let image = UIImage(data: data) {
   UIImageWriteToSavedPhotosAlbum(image, nil, nil, nil)
}
```
Just **change urls into your image URL**

> UIImageWriteToSavedPhotosAlbum will take care it to download to device.

## API

API(Application Programming Interface) is an interface that defines interactions between multiple software applications or mixed hardware-software intermediaries. It defines the kinds of calls or requests that can be made, how to make them, the data formats that should be used, the conventions to follow, etc.

### Various API Site
- [rapidAPI](https://www.rapidapi.com)
- [AnyAPI](https://any-api.com/)
- [Programmableweb](https://www.programmableweb.com/)

## JSON
JSON is a language-independent data format
> Which is relative with **KEY - VALUE** pair
```json
{
    "main": [
        {
            "title": "example1",
            "body": "body1"
        },
        {
            "title": "example2",
            "body: "body2"
        }
    ]
}
```
### JSON parser extension for Chrome
This extension makes JSON more structable
[JSON parser pro](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/json-viewer-pro/eifflpmocdbdmepbjaopkkhbfmdgijcc) **FREE** :+1:

## JSONDecoder

To use JSONDecoder in swift, you have to define the model to be Codable or Decodable

```swift
public typealias Codable = Decodable & Encodable
```

> Decodable can only decode the json data. Can't encoded json file!!

```swift
struct User: Codable {
    var firstName: String
    var lastName: String
    var country: String
    
    enum CodingKeys: String, CodingKey {
        case firstName = "first_name"
        case lastName = "last_name"
        case country
    }
}

```
> To avoid snake_case in swift, use CodingKeys or JSONDecoder.KeyDecodingStrategy

To use JSONDecoding, declare JSONDecoder and use decode() function

```swift
 do {
    let data = try JSONDecoder().decode(T.self, from: unwrappedData)
    completionOnMain(.success(data))
} catch {
    print(error)
    completionOnMain(.failure(.parseError))
}
 ```
 
T.self -> Model(Struct) of the data that you want to decode
 > data will decoded to form of T

unwrappedData -> Input actual data from file or server
> This should be a Data Type!!
 
## JSONSerialization

JSONSerialization is a old way of decode the JSON file.
> Apple populated Codable since Swift 4

### Example

Example of number.json data

```json
{
    "number": [
        {
            "name": "Dennis",
            "number": "111-222-3333"
        },
        {
            "name": "Jenny",
            "number": "444-555-6666"
        },
        {
            "name": "Ben",
            "number": "777-888-9999"
        }
    ]
}

```

Here is a example of JSONSerialization with actaul JSON file in project folder
> Otherwise you can use URL!

```swift
    private func populateDataFromJson() {
        
        if let path = Bundle.main.path(forResource: "NumberData", ofType: "json") {
            do {
                let dataJson = try Data(contentsOf: URL(fileURLWithPath: path))
                let jsonDict = try JSONSerialization.jsonObject(with: dataJson, options: .mutableContainers)
                if let jsonResults = jsonDict as? [String: Any],
                   let results = jsonResults["number"] as? [[String: Any]] {
                    results.forEach { dict in
                        // simply appended to list(array)
                        self.phoneNumberList.append(PhoneNumber(name: dict["name"] as? String ?? "", number: (dict["number"] as? String ?? "")))
                        self.phoneNumberListClone.append(PhoneNumber(name: dict["name"] as? String ?? "", number: (dict["number"] as? String ?? "")))
                    }
                }
            } catch {
                print(error.localizedDescription)
            }
        }
    }
```

> .mutableContainers allows to working like a array and dictionary type


### JSON Parser Library

This library provide JSON parsing 

- [SwifyJSON](https://github.com/SwiftyJSON/SwiftyJSON)

## Notification Center


## UserDefaults

The UserDefaults class provides a programmatic interface for interacting with the defaults system. Check [Apple Document](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/foundation/userdefaults) for more info
> UserDefaults has to have **key-value** pair

### When do we use UserDafaults

- User information, like name, email address, age, occupation
- App settings, like user interface language, app color theme or ‚Äúdetailed vs. simple UI‚Äù
- Flags, more on this later
- If store data is small 

## How to find documentDirectory 

Put this line of code inside of your project
```swift
func application(_ application: UIApplication, didFinishLaunchingWithOptions launchOptions: [UIApplication.LaunchOptionsKey: Any]?) -> Bool {
        print(NSSearchPathForDirectoriesInDomains(.documentDirectory, .userDomainMask, true).last ?? "")
        return true
    }
```

<img src = "https://github.com/jphong1111/Useful_Swift/blob/main/Images/DocumentPath.png" />

simply move into that path and you can find the documentDirectory of your Application
> if Library is not shown up, just do **Shift + Command + .** to show hidden files in your folder

<img src = "https://github.com/jphong1111/Useful_Swift/blob/main/Images/UserDefaultPlistPath.png" />

## Usage

As you can see in the below, intArray will stored inside the device through UserDefaults(), so that if device is shut down, changed value wil be stored in device.

```swift
class ViewController: UIViewController {
    var intArray = [1,2,3,4,5]
    let defaults = UserDefaults()
    
    override func viewDidLoad() {
        super.viewDidLoad()
        intArray = defaults.array(forKey: "IntArray") as! [Int]
    }
    
    @IBOutlet weak var textField: UILabel!
    @IBAction private func isClicked(_ sender: UIButton) {
        intArray.append(6)
        defaults.set(intArray, forKey: "IntArray")
        textField.text = "\(intArray)"
    }
}
```
You can your plist file like this!

<img src = "https://github.com/jphong1111/Useful_Swift/blob/main/Images/UserDefaultPlist.png" />

Declare Userdefault like this!

```swift
let defaults = UserDefaults.standard
```
> **standard** allows to access from anywhere inside device

**With using set function, you can set userdefaults**

<img src = "https://github.com/jphong1111/Useful_Swift/blob/main/Images/UserDefaultSet.png" width = "60%" height = "60%"/>

**Also these function will allow to get a data from plist**

<img src = "https://github.com/jphong1111/Useful_Swift/blob/main/Images/UserDefaultGet.png" width = "60%" height = "60%"/>

## Core Data

Use Core Data to save your application‚Äôs permanent data for offline use, to cache temporary data, and to add undo functionality to your app on a single device.

**Core Data in Swift is using SQLite as DEFAULT**

<img src = "https://github.com/jphong1111/Useful_Swift/blob/main/Images/DataStoreInSwift.png" width = "50%" height = "50%"/>

> Image From London App Brewery

### Set Up Core Data

Simply Click Core Data check box when you create a new project

<img src = "https://github.com/jphong1111/Useful_Swift/blob/main/Images/AddCoreData.png" width = "50%" height = "50%"/>

If you want to attach Core Data in exsiting project

Create **Data Model** file first

<img src = "https://github.com/jphong1111/Useful_Swift/blob/main/Images/AddDataModel.png" width = "50%" height = "50%"/>

Then import CoreData inside your **AppDelegate.swift** file

```swift
import CoreData
```

And Copy and Paste this lines of code inside your **AppDelegate.swift** file

```swift
    // MARK: - Core Data stack

    lazy var persistentContainer: NSPersistentContainer = {
        /*
         The persistent container for the application. This implementation
         creates and returns a container, having loaded the store for the
         application to it. This property is optional since there are legitimate
         error conditions that could cause the creation of the store to fail.
        */
        let container = NSPersistentContainer(name: "Your DataModel file name")
        container.loadPersistentStores(completionHandler: { (storeDescription, error) in
            if let error = error as NSError? {
                // Replace this implementation with code to handle the error appropriately.
                // fatalError() causes the application to generate a crash log and terminate. You should not use this function in a shipping application, although it may be useful during development.
                 
                /*
                 Typical reasons for an error here include:

                 * The device is out of space.
                 * The store could not be migrated to the current model version.
                 Check the error message to determine what the actual problem was.
                 */
                fatalError("Unresolved error \(error), \(error.userInfo)")
            }
        })
        return container
    }()

    // MARK: - Core Data Saving support

    func saveContext () {
        let context = persistentContainer.viewContext
        if context.hasChanges {
            do {
                try context.save()
            } catch {
                // Replace this implementation with code to handle the error appropriately.
                // fatalError() causes the application to generate a crash log and terminate. You should not use this function in a shipping application, although it may be useful during development.
                let nserror = error as NSError
                fatalError("Unresolved error \(nserror), \(nserror.userInfo)")
            }
        }
    }
```

Don't forget to change it
```swift
let container = NSPersistentContainer(name: "Your DataModel file name")
```

And goto **SceneDelegate.swift** file, copy below lines of code and replace yours

```swift
func sceneDidEnterBackground(_ scene: UIScene) {
        // Called as the scene transitions from the foreground to the background.
        // Use this method to save data, release shared resources, and store enough scene-specific state information
        // to restore the scene back to its current state.

        // Save changes in the application's managed object context when the application transitions to the background.
        (UIApplication.shared.delegate as? AppDelegate)?.saveContext()
    }
```

If your target is **below iOS13**, put this line of code in side your **applicationWillTerminate** of **AppDelegate.swift** file

```swift
self.saveContext()
```

## Core Data Usage

Once you create your DataModel file, you can simply create a **Entity(Class)** and **Attributes(Properties)**

And then, change the type of attributes in inspector like this

<img src = "https://github.com/jphong1111/Useful_Swift/blob/main/Images/DataModelAttribute_inspector.png"/>

Once you create your own Entities & Attributes, go to Inspector and change Module to **CurrentProductModule**

<img src = "https://github.com/jphong1111/Useful_Swift/blob/main/Images/DataModelAttributes.png"/>

> If you didn't set it, thats fine, but if you are working in big project, then you need to set it. Otherwise this can occurs some error.

### Codegen

As you can see in above, there are three options

- Manual/None - Swift didn't generate CoreDataClass, CoreDataProperties files so that you have to create yourself **(full control)**
- Class Definition - Swift will generate CoreDataClass, CoreDataProperties files. **(No control)**
- Category/Extension - Swift will generate only Extension file **(Some Control)**

CoreDataClass, CoreDataProperties are located in below

 > /Users/dennis/Library/Developer/Xcode/DerivedData/CoreDataUserDefaultPractice-hisefjfyuvglrjekndpftwazftug/Build/Intermediates.noindex/CoreDataUserDefaultPractice.build/Debug-iphonesimulator/CoreDataUserDefaultPractice.build/DerivedSources/CoreDataGenerated/CoreDataUserDefaultPractice 

And CoreDataClass, CoreDataProperties are looking like this,

<img src = "https://github.com/jphong1111/Useful_Swift/blob/main/Images/CoreDataClass_Properties.png"/>

> If your code can run it but didn't get your Entities, **Rebuild it or Restart your Xcode**

## Store Data

Declare context as a global variable

```swift
let context = (UIApplication.shared.delegate as! AppDelegate).persistentContainer.viewContext
```
> Get viewContext that we defined in AppDelegate.swift file

Simply you can use this code to save your data to CoreData
```swift
func saveItem() {
        do {
            try context.save()
        } catch {
            print("Error Saving Context: \(error.localizedDescription)")
        }
    }
```
> Use it wherever you want

Data can be find if you print the path

```swift
print(FileManager.default.urls(for: .documentDirectory, in: .userDomainMask))
```

<img src = "https://github.com/jphong1111/Useful_Swift/blob/main/Images/CoreDataSQLite.png" />

> You can check Entities, Properties inside that file

## Load Data

Refer this code and apply it to your code wherever you want to reload it
```swift
    func loadItem() {
        let request: NSFetchRequest<Item> = Item.fetchRequest()
        do {
            itemArray = try context.fetch(request)
        } catch {
            print("Load Item Error: \(error.localizedDescription)")
        }
    }
```
> Item will be your Entity, itemArray will be your Entity object
> Don't forget to import **CoreData**

## Update Data

Simply use setValue function so that you can update your value in DB

```swift
itemArray[0].setValue(<#T##value: Any?##Any?#>, forKey: <#T##String#>)
```
> if you are using TableView or CollectionView, change 0 to indexPath.row

## Delete Data

Simply use delete function in context

```swift
context.delete(itemArray[0])
```
> change number for dynamic!

## Third Party Library

Third Party Library saves you time as you do not need to develop the functionality that the library provides. 
[SHOULD DEVELOPERS USE THIRD-PARTY LIBRARIES?](https://www.scalablepath.com/blog/third-party-libraries/)
> Relying on library(abused) is not a good idea

 - [awesome ios github](https://github.com/vsouza/awesome-ios) Contains all the popular libraries in Swift:+1:
 - [awesome swift site](https://swift.libhunt.com/) You can broswe popular libraries related to iOS

## Dependency/Package Manager

A package manager is a tool that simplifies the process of working with code from multiple sources.

- Centralised hosting of packages and source code with public server with access to developers or contributors
- Download the source code at the run time, so that we don‚Äôt need to include it in the repository
- Link the source code to our working repository by including source files

[More Info](https://medium.com/xcblog/swift-dependency-management-for-ios-3bcfc4771ec0)

## CocoaPods

Download cocoapods

```bash
$ sudo gem install cocoapods
```

After finish download cocoapods, go to your root folder of your project and make pod file

```bash
$ pod init
```

Click into your pod file and edit

## Localization

Localization is the process of making your app support other languages. (Base language is English)

 - [Localization Apple](https://developer.apple.com/localization/)
 - [Localization Apple Developer](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/xcode/localization)
 - [iOS Localization Tutorial](https://medium.com/lean-localization/ios-localization-tutorial-938231f9f881)
 - [Internationalizing Your iOS App: Getting Started](https://www.raywenderlich.com/250-internationalizing-your-ios-app-getting-started)
 
## Localization Usage

First, you have to check **Use Base Internationalization**
> It might be checked

<img src = "https://github.com/jphong1111/Useful_Swift/blob/main/Images/Internationalization.png" width="50%" height ="50%" />

> English is a base Language

After you check it, add languages that you want to support in your App

<img src = "https://github.com/jphong1111/Useful_Swift/blob/main/Images/Internationalization2.png" width="50%" height ="50%" />

Then, you can check your language file like this!

<img src = "https://github.com/jphong1111/Useful_Swift/blob/main/Images/Internationalization3.png" width="50%" height ="50%" />

Create **Localizable.strings** file into your project
> Unlike Swift, the .strings file requires that each line terminate with a **semicolon**
> .strings file is where you can add translation data as **key-value** pairs

<img src = "https://github.com/jphong1111/Useful_Swift/blob/main/Images/Internationalization4.png" width="50%" height ="50%" />

In your .strings file, check localization button and choose language

<img src = "https://github.com/jphong1111/Useful_Swift/blob/main/Images/Internationalization5.png" width="50%" height ="50%" />

And then add Key - Value pairs for tanslation

<img src = "https://github.com/jphong1111/Useful_Swift/blob/main/Images/Internationalization6.png" width="50%" height ="50%"/>

To use localization, use **NSLocalizedString** to implement it

```swift
NSLocalizedString(<#T##key: String##String#>, comment: <#T##String#>)
```
 - [key] - put (key - value) pair that you created in .strings file
 - [comment] - It will help your translators significantly and result in better translations

Simple example below

```swift
@IBAction func showAlert() {
        let alertTitle = NSLocalizedString("Welcome", comment: "")
        let alertMessage = NSLocalizedString("How are you", comment: "")
        let cancelButtonText = NSLocalizedString("Cancel", comment: "")
        let signupButtonText = NSLocalizedString("Signup", comment: "")

        let alert = UIAlertController(title: alertTitle, message: alertMessage, preferredStyle: UIAlertController.Style.alert)
        let cancelAction = UIAlertAction(title: cancelButtonText, style: UIAlertAction.Style.cancel, handler: nil)
        let signupAction = UIAlertAction(title: signupButtonText, style: UIAlertAction.Style.default, handler: nil)
        alert.addAction(cancelAction)
        alert.addAction(signupAction)
        present(alert, animated: true, completion: nil)
    }
```
 
 After that, we have to test if localization is working correctly or not
 
 To test it, you can do either **Edit Scheme** or **New Scheme**
 
 go to Run section, and change **App Language**
 
 <img src = "https://github.com/jphong1111/Useful_Swift/blob/main/Images/Internationalization7.png" />
 
 After finish setting Scheme try to run it!
 
  <img src = "https://github.com/jphong1111/Useful_Swift/blob/main/Images/Internationalization8.png" width="50%" height ="50%" />
  <img src = "https://github.com/jphong1111/Useful_Swift/blob/main/Images/Internationalization9.png" width="50%" height ="50%" />

## Accessibility

Accessibility is all about making the iPhone, iPod touch, and iPad work for as wide a range of people as possible. That can include the very young, the very old, people brand new to computers and mobile devices, and also people with disabilities and special needs. 

- Designing your app for accessibility makes it easier to write functional tests, whether you‚Äôre using the UI Testing in Xcode.
- You‚Äôll also broaden your market and user base by making your app usable by a larger group.
- Implementing accessibility in your app shows you‚Äôre willing to go the extra mile for every user, and that‚Äôs a good thing.

- [iOS Accessibility: Getting Started](https://www.raywenderlich.com/6827616-ios-accessibility-getting-started)


## Accessibility Usage

To use accessibility, you have to enable this
> For most UIKit classes, **the default is true, but for UILabel it‚Äôs false**

```swift
label.isAccessibilityElement = true
```

 - accessibilityLabel - short description of control e.g. "Save" for button, "Rating" for label
 - accessibilityHint - helps the user to understand result of the action e.g "Save the documents"
 - accessibilityTraits - collection of constants that describe the type of control and/or hot it should be treated
 - accessibilityValue - Used to describe the value of a none-label UI component e.g. "50%" for progress bar

## GCD
GCD(Grand Central Dispatch) is a low-level API for managing concurrent operations. It can help you improve your app‚Äôs responsiveness by deferring computationally expensive tasks to the background.

## DispatchQueue
An object that manages the execution of tasks serially or concurrently on your app's main thread or on a background thread.

#### main
We can say main is a serial queue

#### global()
We can say global is a concurrent queue

## DispatchGroup


## DispatchWorkItem

## Thread Sanitizer
Thread Sanitizer is a tool to identifies the potential thread-related corruption issues. And it is a good way to find the [Readers and Writers problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Readers%E2%80%93writers_problem) in your application.

And then go to **RUN** and check **THREAD SANITIZER** üëà

<img src="https://github.com/jphong1111/Useful_Swift/blob/main/Images/thread_sanitizer.png">

## Testing



## Code Coverage

Before start your Testing, add coverage will be a good option to show the result of test

First, check code coverage

<img src ="https://github.com/jphong1111/Useful_Swift/blob/main/Images/addCoverage1.png" />

Then, go to **EDIT SHEME**, check like this

## SSL Pinning

<img src = "https://github.com/jphong1111/awesome-ios-developer/blob/main/Images/SSLCertificate.png"/>

When a mobile app communicates with a server, it uses SSL(Secure Socket Layer) pinning technique for protecting the transmitted data against tampering and eavesdropping.

 - [Preventing Man-in-the-Middle Attacks in iOS with SSL Pinning](https://www.raywenderlich.com/1484288-preventing-man-in-the-middle-attacks-in-ios-with-ssl-pinning)
 - [How to Perform SSL Pinning in iOS Apps](https://appinventiv.com/blog/ssl-pinning-in-ios-app/)

## How SSL Works

1. A browser attempts to connect with a website which is secured with a SSL. The browser then requests the web server to identify itself.
2. Web server then sends the browser its SSL certificate copy.
3. The browser checks if the SSL certificate must be trusted. If it can be, a message is sent to the web server.
4. Web server then sends back an acknowledgement to begin the SSL encrypted session.
5. The encrypted data is then finally shared between the browser and web server.

## SSL pinning methods

 - Pin the certificate ‚Äì you can download the server‚Äôs certificate and bundle them in the app. At the runtime, the app compares the server certificate to ones that you have embedded. 
 - Pin the public key ‚Äì you can retrieve the public key of certificate in the code as string. At the runtime, the application compared the certificate‚Äôs public key to one which is hard-coded in the code. 

## Using URLSession

```swift
func urlSession(_ session: URLSession, didReceive challenge: URLAuthenticationChallenge, completionHandler: @escaping (URLSession.AuthChallengeDisposition, URLCredential?) -> Void) {
    if (challenge.protectionSpace.authenticationMethod == NSURLAuthenticationMethodServerTrust) {
        if let serverTrust = challenge.protectionSpace.serverTrust {
            var secresult = SecTrustResultType.invalid
            let status = SecTrustEvaluate(serverTrust, &secresult)
            
            if (errSecSuccess == status) {
                if let serverCertificate = SecTrustGetCertificateAtIndex(serverTrust, 0) {
                    let serverCertificateData = SecCertificateCopyData(serverCertificate)
                    let data = CFDataGetBytePtr(serverCertificateData);
                    let size = CFDataGetLength(serverCertificateData);
                    let cert1 = NSData(bytes: data, length: size)
                    let file_der = Bundle.main.path(forResource: "name-of-cert-file", ofType: "cer")
                    
                    if let file = file_der {
                        if let cert2 = NSData(contentsOfFile: file) {
                            if cert1.isEqual(to: cert2 as Data) { completionHandler(URLSession.AuthChallengeDisposition.useCredential, URLCredential(trust:serverTrust))
                                return
                            }
                        }
                    }
                }
            }
        }
    }
    
    // Pinning failed completionHandler(URLSession.AuthChallengeDisposition.cancelAuthenticationChallenge, nil)
}
```

## Using Alamofire 5

If you are using above version, this code should be changed

[More Info](https://devgenes.com/posts/SSL-Pinning-With-Alamofire/)

First, Download SSL certificate to your project folder
> https://www.yourdomain.com (NOT IN THIS WAY)

```bash
openssl s_client -showcerts -connect yourdomain.com:443 < /dev/null | openssl x509 -outform DER > yourdomain.cer
```

Make a SessionManager to get SSL Pinning

```swift

let sessionManager: SessionManager = {
    let serverTrustPolicies: [String: ServerTrustPolicy] = ["yourdomain.com": .pinCertificates(certificates: ServerTrustPolicy.certificates(),
                                                                                                validateCertificateChain: true,
                                                                                                validateHost: true)]
    
    return SessionManager(serverTrustPolicyManager: ServerTrustPolicyManager(policies: serverTrustPolicies))
}()
```

request from sessionManager, if it is invalid, print error

```swift
sessionManager.request("https://yourdomain.com").responseString { (dataResponse) in
    switch dataResponse.result {
    case .failure(let err):
        print(err)
    case .success(let val):
        print(val)
        if let headerFields = dataResponse.response?.allHeaderFields {
            print(headerFields)
        }
    }
}
```

### Relative Stuff
TrustKit makes it easy to deploy SSL public key pinning

[TrustKit](https://github.com/datatheorem/TrustKit)

## Code Obfuscation

Code obfuscation is the act of deliberately obscuring source code, making it very difficult for humans to understand, and making it useless to hackers who may have ulterior motives.

## Cryptography

## Biometric Access

Apple made a big change when it released the iPhone X: It ditched Touch ID fingerprint security for a new face-based biometric sign-on tool called Face ID. The fingerprint scanner on most post-iPhone X Apple products is gone, and in its place is a new camera array capable of capturing a face map that is, according to Apple, 20 times less likely to be hacked than a Touch ID fingerprint.

[Apple's Face ID: Cheat sheet](https://www.techrepublic.com/article/apples-face-id-everything-iphone-x-users-need-to-know/)

## Face ID & Touch ID

To use Face ID, Add **Privacy - Face ID Usage Description** into your info.plist file in your project

<img src = "https://github.com/jphong1111/Useful_Swift/blob/main/Images/FaceID_Info.png" width = "50%" height = "50%"/>

import LocalAuthentication, which can allow you to implement Biometric Access

```swift
import LocalAuthentication
```

After that, using LAContext() we can implement Face ID

Here are simple example that how Face ID can impelement

```swift
@IBAction private func isTouched(_ sender: UIButton!) {
        let context = LAContext()
        var error: NSError? = nil
        if  context.canEvaluatePolicy(.deviceOwnerAuthenticationWithBiometrics, error: &error) {
            let reason = "touch id"
            context.evaluatePolicy(.deviceOwnerAuthenticationWithBiometrics, localizedReason: reason) { [weak self](success, error) in
                DispatchQueue.main.async {
                   
                    guard success, error == nil else {
                        // If Fail
                        let alert  = UIAlertController(title: "FAceID Fail", message: "error", preferredStyle: .alert)
                        let action = UIAlertAction(title: "cancle", style: .cancel, handler: nil)
                        alert.addAction(action)
                        self?.present(alert, animated: true, completion: nil)
                        return
                    }
                    // If success
                    let vc = UIViewController()
                    vc.title = "hi"
                    vc.view.backgroundColor = .blue
                    self?.present(vc, animated: true, completion: nil)
                }
            }
        } else {
            // If device is not supporting Face ID
        }
    }
```

Copy this code and Paste into your controller

```swift
#if canImport(SwiftUI) && DEBUG
import SwiftUI
struct SwiftLeeViewRepresentable: UIViewRepresentable {
    func makeUIView(context: Context) -> UIView {
        return UIStoryboard(name: "Main", bundle: Bundle.main).instantiateInitialViewController()!.view
    }
    
    func updateUIView(_ view: UIView, context: Context) {
        
    }
}

@available(iOS 13.0, *)
struct SwiftLeeViewController_Preview: PreviewProvider {
    static var previews: some View {
        SwiftLeeViewRepresentable()

## Managing Xcode Space

This will be helful when you are running out of storage in your mac

```bash
# 1
echo "Removing Derived Data..."
rm -rf ~/Library/Developer/Xcode/DerivedData/

# 2
echo "Removing Device Support..."
rm -rf ~/Library/Developer/Xcode/iOS\ DeviceSupport
rm -rf ~/Library/Developer/Xcode/watchOS\ DeviceSupport
rm -rf ~/Library/Developer/Xcode/tvOS\ DeviceSupport

# 3
echo "Removing old simulators..."
xcrun simctl delete unavailable

# 4
echo "Removing caches..."
rm -rf ~/Library/Caches/com.apple.dt.Xcode
rm -rf ~/Library/Caches/org.carthage.CarthageKit

# 5
if command -v pod  &> /dev/null
then
    # 6
    pod cache clean --all
fi

echo "Done!"
```

After writing, run it with this command

```bash
chmod u+x clean-xcode.sh
```

And then

```script
./clean-xcode.sh
```

**This will cleans out derived data, device support, simulators and caches. So that once you execute it, You have to build your project AGAIN**
